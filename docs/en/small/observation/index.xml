      <description>This online assessment method is suitable for this scale. The video recordings can be made individually or as a group. If the recordings are made individually, only one person needs to be in the picture, making it easier to make a clear video recording. If the recording is of a group, such as a theatre performance, the best way to assess the performance is by filming the group as a whole.</description>

      <description>Some activities, such as an holding an interview or using software, may be carried out by the student at home (or at another location). Other activities, such as a theatre performance or an activity during an internship, are more difficult to assess remotely.
The examiner may choose to watch the activity live, in which case video conferencing or live streaming will be used. In this case, the assessment is location independent, but not time independent.</description>

Tips for this assessment method
*Make sure that the rules and requirements for making a video recording are clear, and don’t forget the audio.
*Use a live recording if it is necessary to intervene in the activity or discuss it immediately afterwards, or if the activity needs to be done properly in one go or within a certain time. Otherwise, it is easier to make a video recording.</description>

      <description>*To make a video recording, the student may need equipment such a good camera, a tripod and one or more microphones. The student needs access to such equipment. Institutions also have special equipment for recording certain activities such as a lesson.
*If the students need to set up the recording equipment themselves, provide them with a checklist with clear instructions to ensure that the examiner can see everything they need to.</description>
